# Hey, I'm Sally.
I draw [cartoons](http://comics.fixpert.com) and ride bikes. 
I also lead Product Design and User Research at [Duo Security](http://duo.com).

I make comics about my life and about bikes. I work with bicycle advocacy organizations like Bike East Bay and Common Cycle to make informational comics like [How to Fix a Flat](http://comics.fixpert.com/comics/how-to-fix-a-flat-bicycle-tire-downloadable-instructions.html).

I spent the last few years building a company called [Pinoccio](https://pinocc.io/). Pinoccio is a tiny wireless computer that helps smart people build neat web-connected projects like this LED toy from [Jake](https://twitter.com/jingman).
